# Date: 2025-10-19
# Author: Mitra Aftabi

## Project Overview
Comparison of parallel computing methods (furrr, future, parallel) for 
accelerating bootstrap confidence interval calculations in plant breeding data.

## Dataset
- Source: crossa.wheat from agridat package
- Size: 450 observations, 18 genotypes, 25 locations
- Analysis: Bootstrap CI for mean yield per genotype

## Key Results

### Performance (5 genotypes, 5000 bootstrap replicates)
Method      | Time   | Speedup | Efficiency
------------|--------|---------|------------
Serial      | 4.19s  | 1.00x   | 16.67%
furrr       | 2.71s  | 1.55x   | 25.77%
future      | 1.47s  | 2.85x   | 47.51%
parallel    | 1.28s  | 3.27x   | 54.56%

### Scalability Findings
- Best for small tasks (â‰¤5 items): future (up to 5.71x speedup!)
- Best for large tasks (>5 items): furrr (consistent 2.5-3x speedup)
- parallel package: Good for 5 items, degrades with more

## Recommendations
1. For production use: future or furrr
2. For beginners: furrr (tidyverse syntax)
3. For flexibility: future (multiple backends)
4. For no dependencies: parallel (built-in)

## Files Created
- figures/: 4 visualization plots
- results/: All benchmark data and summaries
- documentation/: Installation and usage guides

## Hardware
- CPU: 8 cores (used 6 for parallel)
- Platform: Windows
- R version: 4.5.1
