# Parallel Computing for Plant Phenotype Bootstrap Analysis

## Required Packages

### Core Packages (Must Install)
install.packages('agridat')      # Agricultural datasets
install.packages('boot')         # Bootstrap methods
install.packages('tidyverse')    # Data manipulation

### Parallel Computing Packages
install.packages('furrr')        # Future + purrr (easiest)
install.packages('future')       # Parallel framework
install.packages('future.apply') # For future_lapply

### Note: parallel package comes with R (no installation needed)

## System Requirements
- R version >= 4.0
- Multi-core CPU (4+ cores recommended)
- 8GB RAM minimum
- Works on: Windows, Mac, Linux

## Installation Test
# Verify all packages loaded successfully:
library(agridat)
library(boot)
library(tidyverse)
library(furrr)
library(future)
library(future.apply)
library(parallel)

# Check available cores
detectCores()

## Quick Start Example
library(furrr)
plan(multisession, workers = 4)  # Use 4 cores

# Your parallel code here...
# Example:
results <- future_map(1:10, ~mean(rnorm(1000)))

## Recommendations by Workload
- Small tasks (< 5 items): Use 'future' (lowest overhead)
- Medium tasks (5-10 items): Use 'furrr' (best balance)
- Large tasks (10+ items): Use 'furrr' (best scaling)
- No dependencies needed: Use 'parallel' (built-in)

## Troubleshooting
- Windows users: All methods work! Use parLapply for parallel package
- Mac/Linux users: All methods work, can also use mclapply
- Memory issues: Reduce number of workers
- Slow performance: Increase bootstrap replicates (need more work per task)
